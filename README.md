# Call-Center-Report-2021
The data of call centre employees is visually represented, where many factors like total calls, resolved queries, etc. are graphically plotted on the dashboard, which can help in understanding the workload and productivity of the agents. Data can also be checked for individual agent and compared to others for calculating progress.


The data has call details of customers, whether the calls were attended, and whether the queries raised by customers were resolved by agents. The data also has ratings for agents, invoice dates, and call durations.
The dashboard helps in understanding the performance of each agent, which can be used to determine productivity and areas for improvement for each agent. All data can be compared agent-wise. With the help of the report, necessary measures can be decided, and once taken, the company can definitely improve its growth.Â 

Visuals that are used to represent data graphically are mentioned below:

1. Call data: number of calls, number of calls received, number of calls missed, number of queries resolved, and number of queries not resolved by agents.

2. Issues resolved and not resolved are plotted in clustered bar graphs which are differentiated by agent name.

3. Pie chart is used to show calls per agent.

4. Average rating of all agents.

5. Donut chart is used for answered and unanswered calls details.

6. Stacked column chart is used for answered and unanswered calls details.
